Explanation:

1.Base Cases:
  .If both nodes p and q are nullptr, return true since both subtrees are empty.
  .If only one of p or q is nullptr, return false as the trees are not identical.

2.Recursive Check:
  .Check if the values of the current nodes p and q are the same.
  .Recursively call isSameTree on the left children of p and q.
  .Recursively call isSameTree on the right children of p and q.

3.Return:
The result of (p->val == q->val) and the recursive results on the left and right subtrees will determine if the trees are the same.


bool isSameTree(struct TreeNode* p, struct TreeNode* q) {
     // If both nodes are NULL, they are the same
    if (p == NULL && q == NULL) {
        return true;
    }
    
    // If only one of the nodes is NULL, they are not the same
    if (p == NULL || q == NULL) {
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check if the current nodes have the same value and
    // recursively check the left and right subtrees
    return (p->val == q->val) && 
           isSameTree(p->left, q->left) &&
           isSameTree(p->right, q->right);
}
